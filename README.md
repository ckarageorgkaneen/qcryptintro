## An Introduction to Quantum Cryptography

This paper was written as part of a Quantum Technology course project with the attempt of providing a gentle introduction 
to the field of quantum cryptography, with a focus on the fundamental quantum key distribution method underlying it.  
It is ideally aimed towards an undergraduate-level audience familiarized with basic quantum computation notation and operations.
